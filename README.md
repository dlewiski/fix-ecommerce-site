 * Adding a product updates the cart total on the products index page without refreshing the page

## Additional features
* Ensure that users can't order a negative number of items.
* Add flash messages for signing up, signing in and signing out.
* Allow other than whole dollar amounts for admin product creation (for instance, 3.99).
* Add product update and delete functionality for admins.
* Add product validations.
* Add password validations to ensure a user's password is sufficiently complex.

## Current Errors/bugs
* The add new product form was mis labeled, changed "password" to "price"





## Original README

E-commerce site. Uses `bcrypt` and `materialize`. There's a seed file. Set up your own admin. If you have questions, I'll be in Bali with no email. Ask someone else.

To set up:

* `rake db:setup`

* Sorry, didn't get around to tests. It mostly works. There might be a few bugs.
